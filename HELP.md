# Known Issues

**Certain Buildings like the Blue palace, the College of Winterhold and others keep crashing on entering (with error code 12FDD00):**

Enable "LostLegacy_Lux_Crash-Fixes" at the bottom of the left panel of MO2, as seen [Here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/862000050812354610/1001988040446718083/unknown.png). It is located in the "OPTIONALS" Section, feel free to use the search bar at the bottom if needed. This should fix the crashes, but please note that not all locations have been patched yet, so it is not guaranteed to work. Please consult the discord if you have questions about this or need help.
